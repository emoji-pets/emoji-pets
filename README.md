# EmojiPetz

### Goals and Motivations in Deciding to Do This:

     We chose to develop Emoji Pets to learn as much android development we could in a short
	 amount of time. We felt the best way to do that would be through developing an Android game.
	 We chose Emoji Pets so we could develop something that could go in any directions as our skills
	 allowed us to. This way would could work on basic implementations and then build out more features.


##### In summary:

- have fun making something cool
- have a project that could go in any direction, allowing us full creativity in applying what we are learning
- explore the "emoji problem" as a construct in society, breaking ground and treading upon new cultural insights into its meaning as we construct an app for it
- I through it out there as a last minute thought (Nick typing) and people voted on it, so we did it
